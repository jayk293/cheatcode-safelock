# cheatcode-safelock

initial draft of cheatcode-safelock

A combination lock sketch inspired by cheatcodes in the GTA franchise. You can set a passcode with the combination of the buttons on your controller.
Currently only supports PS3 controller via [USB HOST SHEILD](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-usb-host-shield).
Support for PS4/XBOX360/XBOXONE is coming, as well as bluetooth support.
I am more of a software engineer than an electrical engineer, hence why this code does not feature a whole lot of interaction with the base board. I hope to get better at it.

This sketch is dependant on: 
[USB_HOST_SHIELD_2.0](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0)
